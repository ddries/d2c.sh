# d2c.sh

Update Cloudflare DNS 'A' and 'AAAA' records for your dynamic IP.

---

d2c.sh (Dynamic DNS Cloudflare) is a very simple bash script to automatically update the IP address of A and AAAA DNS records from Cloudflare.

### Configure

d2c.sh is configured using TOML files located in `/etc/d2c/`. The first time you run d2c.sh from the command-line, it will create the config directory for you. You will then need to manually create one or more TOML configuration files.

The script processes all files in `/etc/d2c/` directory that end with `.toml`, e.g. `/etc/d2c/d2c.toml`, `/etc/d2c/zone1.toml` or `/etc/d2c/zone2.toml`.

Syntax:

```toml
[api]
zone-id = "aaa" # your DNS zone ID
api-key = "bbb" # your API key with DNS records permissions

[[dns]]
name = "dns1.example.com" # DNS name
proxy = true              # Proxied by Cloudflare?

[[dns]]
name = "dns2.example.com"
proxy = false

[[dns]]
name = "dns6.example.com"
proxy = false
ipv6 = true
```

When d2c.sh is run, it will process each `*.toml` TOML file in the `/etc/d2c/` directory, updating the records configured in each with the current public IP of the machine. The A / AAAA records must be created from the Cloudflare dashboard first; then d2c.sh will be able to update them with the server's public IP. Make sure to create the correct type of record (A or AAAA) according to IPv4 or IPv6, as d2c.sh will ignore misconfigured records.

### Notifications

If the `APPRISE_SIDECAR_URL` environment variable is set, a notification will be sent out to the
specified [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api) service when a record is updated or if a failure is encountered.

### Usage

```sh
$ d2c.sh --help

d2c (Dynamic Dns Cloudflare): Update the Cloudflare DNS A and AAAA records for your dynamic IP.

Usage: d2c.sh

`d2c` UPDATES existing records. Please, create them in Cloudflare Dashboard before running this script.

The configuration is done in `/etc/d2c/*.toml` files in TOML format.
Configuration file structure:

[api]
zone-id = "<zone id>"
api-key = "<api key>"

[[dns]]
name = "test.example.com"
proxy = false

[[dns]]
name = "test2.example.com"
proxy = true

[[dns]]
name = "test-ipv6.example.com"
proxy = false
ipv6 = true # Optional, for AAAA records

```

#### Method 1: Installing d2c.sh

Install d2c.sh using the installation script:

```sh
$ ./install

Successfully installed d2c.sh into /usr/local/bin.
Please, run d2c.sh from command-line before scheduling any cronjob.
Help: `d2c.sh --help` or `d2c.sh -h` or `d2c.sh help`.
```

Then, run d2c.sh from command-line for the first time:

```sh
$ d2c.sh

Directory: /etc/d2c/ does not exist.
Creating...
Created /etc/d2c/. Please, fill the configuration files.
```

Fill the configuration file(s) with your zone id, API key and the desired DNS':

```sh
$ sudo nano /etc/d2c/d2c.toml

[api]
zone-id = "aaa"
api-key = "bbb"
...
```

Finally, you can run manually d2c.sh or set up a cronjob to update periodically:

```sh
$ d2c.sh # manually

[d2c.sh] Processing /etc/d2c/d2c.toml...
[d2c.sh] dns1.example-1.com did not change
[d2c.sh] Processing /etc/d2c/d2c-1.toml...
[d2c.sh] OK dns2.example-2.com

$ crontab -e # set cronjob to run d2c.sh periodically
```

#### Method 2: Executing from URL

You can also execute d2c.sh avoiding the installation. Note that you must still have valid configuration file(s), e.g. `/etc/d2c/d2c.toml`.

Execute from URL:

```sh
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddries/d2c.sh/master/d2c.sh)

[d2c.sh] Processing /etc/d2c/d2c.toml...
[d2c.sh] dns1.example-1.com did not change
[d2c.sh] Processing /etc/d2c/d2c-1.toml...
[d2c.sh] OK dns2.example-2.com
```

To run periodically without installing, you can write your own script:

```sh
$ nano run_d2c.sh

#!/bin/bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddries/d2c.sh/master/d2c.sh)

$ crontab -e # set cronjob to run periodically
```

### Method 3: Docker

To run this script in Docker, build the image with the Dockerfile in the repo.

See `docker-compose.yml` for an example config.

Note: you will need to find a way to run it periodically (e.g. [swarm-cronjob](https://github.com/crazy-max/swarm-cronjob) in Swarm mode).
